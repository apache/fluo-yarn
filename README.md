# Fluo YARN launcher

[![Build Status][ti]][tl] [![Apache License][li]][ll]

A tool for running Apache Fluo applications in Hadoop YARN.

## Requirements

The Fluo YARN launcher requires [Apache Fluo][Fluo] and [Hadoop YARN][YARN]:

| Software    | Recommended Version | Minimum Version |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| [Fluo]      | 1.2.0               | 1.2.0           |
| [YARN]      | 2.7.2               | 2.6.0           |

See the [related projects page][related] for external projects that may help in setting up these dependencies.

## Set up your Fluo application

Before you can launch a Fluo application in YARN, you should follow Fluo's [install instructions][install]
to install Fluo and initialize a Fluo application. After your application has been initialized, follow
the insructions below to install the Fluo YARN launcher and run your application in YARN. Avoid using the
`fluo` command to start local oracle and worker processes if you are running in YARN.

## Install and Configure Fluo YARN launcher

Before you can install the Fluo YARN launcher, you will need to obtain a distribution tarball. It is
recommended that you download the [latest release][release]. You can also build a distribution from the
master branch by following these steps which create a tarball in `distribution/target`:

    git clone https://github.com/apache/fluo-yarn.git
    cd fluo-yarn/
    mvn package

After you obtain a Fluo YARN distribution tarball, follow these steps to install Fluo.

1. Choose a directory with plenty of space, untar the distribution, and run `fetch.sh` to retrieve dependencies:

        tar -xvzf fluo-yarn-1.0.0-bin.tar.gz
        cd fluo-yarn-1.0.0
        ./lib/fetch.sh

    The distribution contains a `fluo-yarn` script in `bin/` that administers Fluo and the
    following configuration files in `conf/`:

    | Configuration file          | Description                                                             |
    |-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | [fluo-yarn-env.sh]          | Configures classpath for `fluo-yarn` script. Required for all commands. |
    | [fluo-yarn.properties]      | Configures how application runs in YARN.  Required for `start` command. |
    | [log4j.properties]          | Configures logging                                                      |

2. Configure [fluo-yarn-env.sh]

    * Set `FLUO_HOME` if it is not in your environment
    * Modify `FLUO_CONN_PROPS` if you don't want use the default.

3. Configure [fluo-yarn.properties] to set how your application will be launched in YARN:

    * YARN resource manager hostname
    * Number of oracle and worker instances
    * Max memory usage per oracle/worker

   If you are managing multiple Fluo applications in YARN, you can copy this file and configure it for
   each application.

## Start Fluo application in YARN

Follow the instructions below to start a Fluo application which contain an oracle and multiple workers.

1. Configure [fluo-yarn-env.sh] and [fluo-yarn.properties] if you have not already.

2. Run the commands below to start your Fluo application in YARN.

        fluo-yarn start myapp conf/fluo-yarn.properties

   The commands will retrieve your application configuration and observer jars (using your
   application name) before starting the application in YARN.

## Manage Fluo application in YARN

Except for stopping your application in YARN, the `fluo` script can be used to manage your application using the
`scan` and `wait` commands.  See Fluo's [install instruction][install] for more information.

When you want you stop your Fluo application, use the the YARN resource manager or the 
`yarn application -kill <App ID>` to stop the application in YARN.
